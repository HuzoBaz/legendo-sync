# Contributing to Legendo Sync

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

- Keep docs in `docs/` up to date when changing APIs
- For new endpoints, add to `docs/api/http.md`
- For new exported functions or components, add to `docs/api/functions.md` and `docs/api/components.md`

## Documentation style

- Use concise, task-oriented language
- Include request/response examples for APIs
- Provide runnable code examples where possible
